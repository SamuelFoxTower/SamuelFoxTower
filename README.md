<h4 style="text-align: center;">Core skills:</h4>
Python, SQL, BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Torch, Git, Jupyter</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">About me</h4>
<p>I am a Data Scientist with experience in data analysis and Python development  
<pre>- My passion is data, identifying patterns and correlations
- Huge interest in many areas of life, which is why this profession was chosen!
- I am a fan of technology and new technologies, I am going to the level when I myself will create breakthrough and useful technologies
- I actively use ChatGPT + AIPRM, AWSCodewhisperer to automate routine tasks,
as well as exploring new approaches
- I am actively studying and creating projects on Arduino and plan to implement my knowledge into projects</pre></p>

- I have studied and applied many technologies in my projects
- Mastering the mathematical basis of machine and deep learning
- Solved many Classification and Regression problems
- Worked with Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, torch, matplotlib...), SQL
- Experience in deep learning (CV, NLP)
- The projects are in [portfolio](https://github.com/Samuel Fox Tower/Portfolio/tree/main/) below, with a description of the tasks and my solution option
- In my solutions, I have always tried to find new ways to optimize the process of studying data
and building models with high quality
